Set: C

Completed:
Informative Chinese Zodiac Web site that uses images as links to other pages.
Images change to a different image when mouse goes over them in the 12 signs
page. Banner and button images have been edited with GIMP. Made favicons for
all pages, depending on the zodiac animal's page, with all other general pages
getting the monkey favicon (as it is the year of the monkey).

Not Completed:
All requirements have been met.

Challenges:
Contact form was a huge pain. Figuring out the exact names to be recognized for
submission caused some initial confusion. Trying to get the mouse hover function
to switch between images took a lot of effort, due to the fact that the css file
was in one folder while the images needed were in another. Redirection was used
using "../images/picture.png" and all was good. As it was a collaborative effort
with a partner, there were some conflicts when we tried to put our code
together, such as css overlap for various elements. These were solved using
class or id in div tags. Placing tables inside the form element was very
confusing. We felt that there was no actual need for using tables. Following
XHTML 1.0 strict guidelines was also very challenging because of various
attributes that were not allowed in XHTML such as the 'required' attribute.

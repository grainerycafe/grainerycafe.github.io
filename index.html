            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The actual history behind the Chinese zodiac is a much less
                fantastical and much harder to find. It’s known from pottery
                artifacts that the animals of the zodiac were popular in the Tang
                Dynasty (618-907 A.D.), but they were also seen much earlier from
                artifacts from the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), a period of
                disunity in ancient Chinese history, as differing factions fought
                for control.</p>
            <p>It’s been written that the animals of the zodiac were brought to
                China via the Silk Road, the same central Asian trade route that
                brought the Buddhist belief from India to China. But some scholars
                argue that the belief predates Buddhism and has origins in early
                Chinese astronomy that used the planet Jupiter as a constant, as
                its orbit around the earth took place every 12 years. Still others
                have argued that the use of animals in astrology began with nomadic
                tribes in ancient China who developed a calendar based on the
                animals they used to hunt and gather.</p>
            <p>This is the most widespread legend about Chinese zodiac. The Jade
                Emperor (The Emperor in Heaven in Chinese folklore) ordered that
                animals would be designated as calendar signs and the twelve that
                arrived first would be selected. At that time, the cat and the rat
                were good friends and neighbors. When they heard of this news, the
                cat said to the rat: 'We should arrive early to sign up, but I
                usually get up late.' The rat then promised to awaken his friend and
                go together. However, on the morning when he got up, he was too
                excited to recall his promise, and went directly to the gathering
                place. On the way, he encountered the tiger, ox, horse, and other
                animals that ran much faster. In order not to fall behind them, he
                thought up a good idea. He made the straightforward ox carry him on
                condition that he sang for the ox. At last, the ox and him arrived
                first. The ox was happy thinking that he would be the first sign of
                the years, but the rat had already slid in front, and became the
                first lucky animal of the Chinese zodiac. Meanwhile his neighbor
                the cat was too late so when it finally arrived, the selection was
                over. That's why other animals appear behind the little rat and why
                the cat hates the rat so much that every time they meet, the cat
                will chase and kill it.</p>
